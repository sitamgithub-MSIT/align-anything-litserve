# Align-DS-V LitServe

[![Open In Studio](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/app-2/studio-badge.svg)](https://lightning.ai/sitammeur/studios/deploy-got-ocr2-model)

Align-DS-V, a vision-language model created by the PKU-Alignment team and HKUST, builds upon the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B architecture. The model demonstrates strong performance across diverse visual question-answering (VQA), chat, and reasoning tasks. This project shows how to create a self-hosted, private API that deploys [reasoning vision-language model](https://huggingface.co/PKU-Alignment/Align-DS-V) with LitServe, an easy-to-use, flexible serving engine for AI models built on FastAPI.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `server.py`: The file containing the main code for the web server.
- `client.py`: The file containing the code for client-side requests.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `README.md`: The README file that contains information about the project.
- `images`: The folder containing test images for the model.
- `assets`: The folder containing screenshots for working on the application.
- `.gitignore`: The file containing the list of files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Tech Stack

- Python (for the programming language)
- PyTorch (for the deep learning framework)
- Hugging Face Transformers Library (for the model)
- LitServe (for the serving engine)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Run the server: `python server.py`
2. Upon running the server successfully, you will see uvicorn running on port 8000.
3. Open a new terminal window.
4. Run the client: `python client.py`

Now, you can see the model's output based on the input request. The model will generate answers based on the input image and question.

## Usage

The project can be used to serve the Align-DS-V vision-language model using LitServe. It allows you to input an image and a question and then get the model's answer. It suggests potential uses in various visual question-answering chats and reasoning tasks.
